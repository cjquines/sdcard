feat:

- header
  - saving queries
  - switching between saved queries
  - editing saved queries, deleting saved queries
- dbview
  - editing categories
  - edit visible columns
  - sorting columns, persist
  - show number selected
- in-sequence
  - set current call
- between sequences:
  - show the next satisfying whatever query
    - maybe each has their own query box even?
  - auto-add a tag when going next (that's in the bottom of the sequence editor?)
  - heads/sides changing
- keyboard shortcuts
  - react-hotkeys-hook

stretch:

- formations:
  - should draw things in a normalized-ish way
  - should let me click at people to label them, add colors
- call metadata:
  - parse calls
  - highlight less frequent calls in the level/tip view, use them to name sequences without comments
    - maybe we can even highlight on-level calls or something idk
  - call frequencies, call length, measure things
  - reassign sequence levels based on highest call?
- sequence metadata:
  - measure how long it takes, how long each call takes
