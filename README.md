feat:

- fix parser again :( check latest C2 file
- header
    - saving queries
    - switching between saved queries
    - editing saved queries, deleting saved queries
- dbview
    - editing categories and tags
    - edit visible columns
        - just remove the goddamn calls column
    - sorting/resizing columns
    - show number selected
    - deleting sequences
- in-sequence
    - set current call
- between sequences:
    - show the next satisfying whatever query
        - maybe each has their own query box even?
    - auto-add a tag when going next (that's in the bottom of the sequence editor?)
    - heads/sides changing
- keyboard shortcuts

stretch:

- formations:
    - should draw things in a normalized-ish way
    - should let me click at people to label them, add colors
- call metadata:
    - parse calls
    - highlight less frequent calls in the level/tip view, use them to name sequences without comments
        - maybe we can even highlight on-level calls or something idk
    - call frequencies, call length, measure things
    - reassign sequence levels based on highest call?
- sequence metadata:
    - measure how long it takes, how long each call takes
