feat:

- editing categories and tags
    - adding comments and such
- saving queries?
    - rename things as queries internally
    - save query, edit query
- in-sequence:
    - comments etc
- between sequences:
    - changing queries?
    - auto-add a tag when going next
    - heads/sides changing
- keyboard shortcuts

stretch:

- formations:
    - should draw things in a normalized-ish way
    - should let me click at people to label them, add colors
- call metadata:
    - parse calls
    - highlight less frequent calls in the level/tip view, use them to name sequences without comments
        - maybe we can even highlight on-level calls or something idk
    - call frequencies, call length, measure things
    - reassign sequence levels based on highest call?
- sequence metadata:
    - measure how long it takes, how long each call takes
